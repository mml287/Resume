###Questions
##1. The question necessitated WASHINGTON to be isolated from the excess information. First, I sorted according to name. Second, I sorted by event type to isolate the storms. Third, I sorted by date and determined how many storms took place each month and found December. Next I subtracted the number of storms from the number of days in the month to find that for 17 days there were no storms.

##2. First I sorted to eliminate county, parish, zone and marine name. Second I sorted by the types of storms. Then I narrowed down the number of trees mentioned in the file. After that I was stumped...

##3. The question required the other 37 states not apart of the 13 colonies to be eliminated from the search. With that done I then sorted according to storms. Then, looking at the damages columns I estimated that  2015 had a higher monetary impact.
